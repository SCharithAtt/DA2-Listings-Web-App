# Listing Management Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the three new features added to enhance listing management in the application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Optional Images When Creating Listings ✅

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `frontend/src/pages/CreateListingPage.tsx`
- Removed image requirement from validation
- Changed label from "Image * (Required)" to "Image (Optional)"
- Removed `required` attribute from file input
- Added conditional image upload - only uploads if user provides an image
- **NEW:** Added image URL input field in create listing form
- Added automatic clearing: selecting file clears URL, entering URL clears file
- Added image preview for both file upload and URL input
- Updated backend endpoint call to use `/images/upload` (renamed endpoint)
- Calls both upload and URL endpoints if images provided

**User Impact:**
- Users can now create listings without uploading an image
- Users can add images via URL directly during listing creation
- Faster listing creation for text-only ads
- More flexible - can use file upload OR URL input
- Image preview works for both methods

**Testing:**
1. Go to Create Listing page
2. Fill in title, description, city, category
3. **Option A:** Leave both image fields empty - should succeed
4. **Option B:** Upload a file - URL field clears automatically
5. **Option C:** Enter image URL - file upload clears automatically
6. **Option D:** Enter invalid URL - preview won't show but form still submits

### 2. Edit Listing Functionality ✅

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `frontend/src/pages/MyListingsPage.tsx`
- Added edit mode state management (`editingId`, `editForm`)
- Created inline edit form with fields for:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Price
  - City (dropdown)
  - Category (dropdown)
  - Tags (comma-separated)
- Added "Edit" button next to each listing
- Implemented `startEdit()`, `handleUpdate()`, and `cancelEdit()` functions
- Used existing backend endpoint: `PUT /listings/{listing_id}`

**User Impact:**
- Users can edit their listings without deleting and recreating
- Inline editing keeps users on the same page
- Save/Cancel buttons for easy workflow
- All main fields are editable

**Testing:**
1. Go to My Listings page
2. Click "Edit" button on any listing
3. Modify fields (title, description, price, etc.)
4. Click "Save" to commit changes
5. Click "Cancel" to discard changes
6. Verify listing updates display correctly

### 3. Add Images via URL ✅

**Backend Changes:**
- Modified `app/routes/listings.py`
- Renamed existing endpoint: `POST /{listing_id}/images` → `POST /{listing_id}/images/upload`
- Created new endpoint: `POST /{listing_id}/images/url`
- URL validation (must start with `http://` or `https://`)
- Authorization check (must own listing)
- Uses MongoDB `$push` to add URL to images array

**Frontend Changes:**
- Modified `frontend/src/pages/MyListingsPage.tsx`
- Added "Image URL" button next to each listing
- Created URL input UI with text field
- Added `handleAddImageByUrl()` function

- Success/error feedback with alerts
- Cancel option to close URL input

**User Impact:**
- Users can add images from existing URLs without uploading files
- Useful for images already hosted online
- Faster than uploading large files
- Works alongside file upload feature

**Testing:**
1. **My Listings Page:**
   - Click "Image URL" button on any listing
   - Enter a valid image URL (e.g., `https://example.com/image.jpg`)
   - Click "Add URL"
   - Image should be added to listing's image array
   - Try invalid URL format - should show error

2. **Create Listing Page (NEW):**
   - During listing creation, use "Or Add Image via URL" field
   - Enter image URL: `https://picsum.photos/400/300`
   - See preview appear below input
   - Submit form - image URL added to new listing
   - View listing detail page to see image
