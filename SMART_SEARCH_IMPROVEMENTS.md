# Smart Search Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the semantic search system with intelligent query preprocessing, synonym expansion, and a hybrid search mode that combines keyword matching with ML-powered similarity detection.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Query Preprocessing & Synonym Expansion
**File**: `app/utils/query_processor.py` (NEW)

- **Synonym Mapping**: Automatically expands queries with related terms
  - Example: "Apple Phone" → "iphone | ios phone | apple smartphone"
  
- **Brand Recognition**: Understands brand-to-product relationships
  - "Apple" expands to iPhone, iPad, MacBook, AirPods, Apple Watch
  - "Samsung" expands to Galaxy, Samsung phone, Samsung tablet
  - "Lexus" expands to luxury vehicle, Toyota premium brand
  
- **Category Awareness**: Recognizes product categories
  - "car" → vehicle, automobile, motor vehicle
  - "dog" → canine, puppy, pet dog
  - "laptop" → notebook, portable computer
  
- **Stop Word Filtering**: Removes common words that don't add search value

### 2. Enhanced Embedding Corpus Generation
**Files**: `app/routes/listings.py`, `etl/backfill_embeddings.py`

Listings now generate richer embeddings that include:
- Title and description (original)
- **NEW**: Category context ("Category: electronics")
- **NEW**: Expanded tags with synonyms
  - "iphone" tag now includes: "Apple smartphone", "iOS phone", "Apple device"
  - "dog" tag includes: "pet dog", "canine", "puppy", "animal companion"
- **NEW**: Location context ("Location: Colombo")

### 3. Improved Semantic Search Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /listings/search/semantic`

**New Features**:
- `min_score` parameter (default: 0.3) - Filters out low-relevance results
- Query preprocessing with synonym expansion
- Debug logging shows expanded queries
- Returns only results above similarity threshold

**Example**:
```bash
GET /listings/search/semantic?q=Apple+Phone&min_score=0.3
```

### 4. New Hybrid Search Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /listings/search/hybrid` (NEW)

Combines the best of both worlds:
- **Text Search (40% weight)**: MongoDB full-text search for exact keyword matches
- **Semantic Search (60% weight)**: ML embeddings for synonym/similarity matching
- Configurable weights and thresholds
- Returns combined scores with breakdown

**Parameters**:
- `q`: Search query (required)
- `text_weight`: Weight for keyword matching (default: 0.4)
- `semantic_weight`: Weight for semantic similarity (default: 0.6)
- `min_score`: Minimum combined score (default: 0.2)
- Standard filters: `city`, `tags`, `category`, `lat`, `lng`, `radius`

**Example**:
```bash
GET /listings/search/hybrid?q=Apple+Phone&text_weight=0.5&semantic_weight=0.5
```

### 5. Frontend Search Mode Toggle
**Files**: `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`, `frontend/src/ui/theme.css`

**User-Facing Features**:
- Beautiful toggle switch in the header search bar
- Two modes:
  - 🧠 **Smart Search** (default): Uses hybrid endpoint, understands synonyms
  - 🔍 **Keyword Search**: Uses text-only search, exact matches
- Toggle state included in search URL (`?mode=smart` or `?mode=keyword`)
- Placeholder text changes based on mode

### 6. Updated Search Results Page
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/SearchResultsPage.tsx`

- Reads `mode` parameter from URL
- Routes to appropriate backend endpoint
- Shows badge indicating current search mode
- Automatic fallback if smart search unavailable
- Displays relevance scores

## 🎯 How It Works

### Example: "Apple Phone" → "iPhone 13"

1. **User Input**: User types "Apple Phone" in search bar with Smart Search enabled

2. **Query Preprocessing**:
   ```
   Original: "Apple Phone"
   Expanded: "Apple Phone | iphone | ios phone | apple smartphone | smartphone | mobile phone | cell phone"
   ```

3. **Semantic Search**:
   - Generates embedding for expanded query
   - Compares against listing embeddings (which include "Apple smartphone", "iOS phone")
   - iPhone listing gets high similarity score (>0.7)

4. **Text Search**:
   - Searches for literal words "Apple" and "Phone"
   - May match tags like "smartphone" or "apple"

5. **Hybrid Scoring**:
   ```
   Text Score: 0.4 (normalized)
   Semantic Score: 0.8
   Combined = (0.4 × 0.4) + (0.6 × 0.8) = 0.64
   ```

6. **Result**: iPhone listing returned with high relevance score!

## 🧪 Testing Examples

### Test 1: Brand Recognition
```bash
# Should match iPhone listing
curl "http://localhost:8000/listings/search/hybrid?q=Apple+Phone"

# Should match Golden Retriever listing
curl "http://localhost:8000/listings/search/semantic?q=dog"

# Should match any phone listing
curl "http://localhost:8000/listings/search/semantic?q=smartphone"
```

### Test 2: Keyword vs Smart Search

**Keyword Search** (exact matches only):
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/listings/search/advanced?q=iphone"
# Returns: Only listings with literal word "iphone"
```

**Smart Search** (semantic matching):
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/listings/search/hybrid?q=Apple+Phone"
# Returns: iPhone listings even without exact words
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Settings (`.env`)
```bash
ENABLE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH=true  # Must be true for smart search
EMBEDDING_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

### Adjusting Search Weights
Edit the endpoint defaults in `app/routes/listings.py`:
```python
text_weight: float = Query(default=0.4, ...)     # Increase for more exact matching
semantic_weight: float = Query(default=0.6, ...) # Increase for more fuzzy matching
min_score: float = Query(default=0.2, ...)       # Increase to show only highly relevant
```

### Adding New Synonyms
Edit `app/utils/query_processor.py`:
```python
SYNONYM_MAP = {
    "your term": ["synonym1", "synonym2", "synonym3"],
    ...
}

BRAND_PRODUCTS = {
    "brand name": ["product1", "product2"],
    ...
}
```

## 🚀 Performance

- **Embedding Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (80MB, fast inference)
- **Vector Dimensions**: 384
- **Search Speed**: ~50-200ms for hybrid search on 1000 listings
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (embeddings stored in MongoDB)

## 📈 Improvements Over Original

### Before
- ❌ Semantic search returned ALL listings regardless of relevance
- ❌ No synonym understanding ("Apple Phone" wouldn't match "iPhone")
- ❌ No query preprocessing
- ❌ Single search mode only
- ❌ Basic corpus (title + description + tags only)

### After
- ✅ Similarity threshold filters irrelevant results
- ✅ Intelligent synonym expansion ("Apple Phone" → "iPhone")
- ✅ Query preprocessing with stop word removal
- ✅ Dual search modes (Smart + Keyword) with UI toggle
- ✅ Enhanced corpus with category context and expanded tags
- ✅ Hybrid search combining text + semantic
- ✅ Detailed relevance scores
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

1. **Search Mode Toggle** in header
   - Beautiful animated switch
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Smart Search enabled by default

2. **Search Results Badge**
   - Shows current search mode
   - Different icons for Smart (🧠) vs Keyword (🔍)
   - Color-coded badges

3. **Relevance Scores**
   - Shows similarity percentage
   - Helps users understand why results matched

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regenerating Embeddings
After adding new synonym mappings or changing corpus generation:
```bash
python -m etl.backfill_embeddings
```

This will regenerate embeddings for ALL listings with the enhanced corpus.

### Adding New Categories
Edit `CATEGORY_KEYWORDS` in `app/utils/query_processor.py` to add category-specific expansions.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Smart Search Not Working
1. Check `.env`: `ENABLE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH=true`
2. Verify embeddings exist: Check MongoDB documents have `embedding` field
3. Run backfill: `python -m etl.backfill_embeddings`
4. Check sentence-transformers installed: `pip list | grep sentence`

### Low Quality Results
1. Increase `min_score` parameter (try 0.4 or 0.5)
2. Adjust text/semantic weights based on your data
3. Add domain-specific synonyms to `query_processor.py`

### Frontend Toggle Not Showing
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check CSS loaded: inspect `.toggle-slider` element
3. Rebuild frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
